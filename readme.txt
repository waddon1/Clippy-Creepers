This is what you might call a remix of samasaurus6's work, featured in https://twitter.com/samasaurus6/status/880364008263622657. samasaurus6 created the model and the texture, but released it as an mcpack that was only compatible with Minecraft PE and Windows10. The idea is too funny to leave it trapped on those platforms.

# Installation
Because vanilla Minecraft (Java) does not allow the modification of entities, this modification pack requires Optifine (https://optifine.net/home).

Put the "Clippy Creepers" folder in the place you normally put your resource packs, start Minecraft with the lastest Optifine release, enable the resource pack, and play as you normally would.
